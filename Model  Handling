## Machine Learning Models Used
#️ Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (Placed / Not Placed).
It works well for structured tabular data and provides probability outputs.
# Random Forest (For Comparison)
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
It generally performs better on complex datasets.
----------Model Performance---------
The models were evaluated using standard classification metrics.
# Accuracy
Logistic Regression: 77.8%
Random Forest: 24.5%
